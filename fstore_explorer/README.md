## 🗺️ Screen Overview

### 🏠 Home Screen
- 2-column product grid with shimmer skeleton on load
- Horizontal category chip filter bar
- Real-time search bar
- Tab filter — **All / Liked ❤️ / Disliked 👎**
- History icon → navigates to History Screen

### 📄 Product Detail Screen
- Full product image, title, price, category badge, rating, description
- Like / Dislike buttons (animated and persistent)
- **"Open in Browser"** button → opens WebView Screen

### 🌐 WebView Screen
- Full in-app browser with progress bar
- Every page visited automatically saved to history
- Refresh button in app bar

### 🕐 History Screen
- All visited URLs sorted newest first
- Product thumbnail shown where available
- Relative timestamps — *"3m ago", "2h ago"*
- Tap any entry to re-open in WebView
- Clear all history with confirmation dialog

---

## 🧠 Approach

### Architecture
Clean layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer** — `ApiService` handles all HTTP calls via Dio. `StorageService` wraps all Hive operations so the rest of the app never touches Hive directly.
- **State Layer** — Riverpod `StateNotifier` classes manage each domain (products, preferences, history) independently.
- **UI Layer** — Screens consume providers via `ConsumerWidget`. Zero business logic in the UI.
- **Utils Layer** — Platform-aware utilities like URL launching are isolated in the `utils/` folder using conditional imports, keeping platform differences out of business logic.

### Offline-First Strategy
Products load from Hive cache instantly on startup, then the API is called silently in the background to refresh data. Users always see content immediately, even on a slow or no connection.

### Platform-Aware URL Launching
The `utils/` folder follows a **conditional import pattern**:

```
url_utils.dart
 ├── imports url_launcher_mobile.dart  →  on Android / iOS
 ├── imports url_launcher_web.dart     →  on Flutter Web
 └── imports url_launcher_stub.dart    →  on unsupported platforms
```

This keeps platform-specific code fully isolated and makes the rest of the app platform-agnostic.

## ⚙️ State Management — Riverpod

**Why Riverpod?**

| Reason | Benefit |
|---|---|
| `StateNotifier` | Clean separation of state logic from UI |
| Provider overrides | Easy to inject `StorageService` initialized in `main()` |
| No `BuildContext` needed | Providers work anywhere, including services |
| Compile-time safety | Catch provider errors at build time, not runtime |
| Easy to test | Override providers in tests with no ceremony |

Three `StateNotifier` providers used:
- `productsProvider` — API fetch, category filter, search, caching
- `preferenceProvider` — like/dislike toggles and persistence
- `historyProvider` — adding and clearing browse history

---

## 💾 Data Persistence — Hive

**Why Hive over SharedPreferences or SQLite?**

- **Speed** — Pure Dart NoSQL; reads/writes are nearly instant
- **No native code** — Works on all platforms without extra setup
- **Type-safe adapters** — `@HiveType` annotations generate compile-safe serialization
- **Simple API** — Feels like a Map but with full persistence

**What is stored:**

| Hive Box | Content |
|---|---|
| `preferences` | Sets of liked and disliked product IDs |
| `history` | `BrowseHistory` objects — url, title, timestamp, image |
| `cached_products` | All products from API for offline access |

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

- **Network errors** — User-friendly message shown with a Retry button on the feed
- **API timeout** — Dio configured with 10s connect and receive timeouts
- **Cached fallback** — If API fails but cache exists, cached data shown silently
- **Image errors** — `CachedNetworkImage` shows a broken image icon gracefully
- **WebView errors** — Loading indicator dismissed cleanly on resource errors
- **URL launch errors** — Stub implementation handles unsupported platforms gracefully

---

## 🔧 What I Would Improve With More Time

1. **Unit & Widget Tests** — Test `ProductsNotifier`, `PreferenceNotifier`, and key widgets
2. **Pagination** — Load products in pages for better performance at scale
3. **Swipe Cards** — Tinder-style swipe left (dislike) / right (like) interaction
4. **Offline Banner** — Show a notice when app is running on cached data
5. **Sort Options** — Sort by price (low/high) and by rating
6. **Share Product** — Share product links via the native share sheet
7. **Dark / Light Theme Toggle** — User-selectable theme preference
8. **Better WebView** — Add forward/back navigation buttons

| Task | Time |
|---|---|
| Project setup + dependencies | ~30 min |
| Models + Hive adapters | ~30 min |
| API service + Storage service | ~45 min |
| Riverpod providers | ~1 hr |
| Home screen + Product card | ~1.5 hr |
| Product detail screen | ~45 min |
| WebView screen + History tracking | ~1 hr |
| History screen | ~30 min |
| Utils — URL launcher (platform-aware) | ~30 min |
| Polish (shimmer, animations, error UI) | ~45 min |
| README + cleanup | ~30 min |
| **Total** | **~8 hrs** |
